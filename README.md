# Phaser 3 Pong

Following a video tutorial on Phaser 3, [How to Really Make a Phaser Game from Scratch!](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLumYWZ2t7CRvdJJ206QarbisxYPAyYwj0) by [Ourcade](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJyrgLkI9LcwzUhZXxrwpyA).

## How to Play

1. Clone repo
2. run `npm install`, to install dependencies
3. run `npm start`, to build and start the game server
4. open a browser window to localhost:1234

Optionally you could deploy this to a web server or package it with something like Electron for desktop use.
